# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to used unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies based on the following properties: algorith used, proof type, total coins mined, and total coin supply. 

## Summary
Upon using the K-means algorithm, the cryptocurrencies best fit into 4 clusters. However, it appears that one of the four clusters may be an outlier. This can be visualized as the orange point on the 3d graph. 

A user can use the visualization section to see the 4 clusters from the algorithm (3D graph), explore individual data for specific types of cryptocurrency (tradable table), and explore the ratio of coins available to coins mined for cryptocurrencies (scatterplot).
